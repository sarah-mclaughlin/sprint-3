1. What is you site's primary purpose?

The primary purpose of my site is to be a space for people to read my blog posts as I go through DevAcademy.

2. Who is your target audience?

Anyone who is interested in DevAcademy and the skills that it teaches you.

3. How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I would like site visitors to be able to navigate the site with ease, read the content with ease, and for the site pages to load quickly so that readers are not having to wait.

4. How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

I will keep the layout/design simple, add 'HOME' buttons to each of the blog pages, limit my paragraph line length, make sure there is sufficient space between paragraph lines, not have too many large images which will slow down how quickly the pages load, and will implement reponsive design (using media queries) so that users can have a positive experience of the site across a range of devices.
